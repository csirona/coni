Checklist to ensure that your FastAPI endpoints are secure, properly documented, and follow RESTful principles for a consistent and user-friendly API design:

**Security:**

1. [ ]  Authentication: Implement a secure authentication mechanism for your API, such as OAuth2, JWT, or API keys.
2. [ ]  Authorization: Define and enforce access control rules to restrict access to specific endpoints based on user roles and permissions.
3. [ ]  Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect against DDoS attacks.
4. [ ]  Input Validation: Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
5. [ ]  Use HTTPS: Ensure that your API is served over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
6. [ ]  Error Handling: Implement proper error handling and return meaningful error messages to clients without revealing sensitive information.
7. [ ]  CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): Configure CORS settings to control which domains can access your API.
8. [ ]  Data Serialization: Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) or other secure serialization formats for sensitive data.

**Documentation:**

1. [ ]  API Documentation Tool: Use a tool like Swagger UI or FastAPI's built-in documentation generator to create interactive API documentation.
2. [ ]  Clear Endpoint Descriptions: Provide clear and concise descriptions for each endpoint, including the purpose, expected input, and response format.
3. [ ]  Request Examples: Include sample request payloads and query parameters in your documentation to help users understand how to interact with your API.
4. [ ]  Response Examples: Include sample response structures to demonstrate what clients can expect when using your API.
5. [ ]  Authentication Instructions: Explain how to authenticate and obtain API tokens or keys, if applicable.
6. [ ]  Versioning: If you plan to make breaking changes in the future, consider including versioning information in your documentation.
7. [ ]  Keep Documentation Updated: Regularly update your documentation to reflect changes in your API.

**RESTful Principles:**

1. [ ]  Resource Naming: Use meaningful and consistent resource names in your endpoints (e.g., `/users` for user-related operations).
2. [ ]  HTTP Verbs: Use appropriate HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to represent CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
3. [ ]  Resource URLs: Structure your URLs logically, with nouns representing resources and not actions (e.g., `/users/123` instead of `/get-user/123`).
4. [ ]  Use HTTP Status Codes: Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 for success, 401 for unauthorized, 404 for not found) in responses.
5. [ ]  Consistent Response Format: Ensure that the response format is consistent across endpoints (e.g., always return data in a JSON format).
6. [ ]  HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State): If applicable, include links to related resources in your API responses to make navigation easier for clients.
