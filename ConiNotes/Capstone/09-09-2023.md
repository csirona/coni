## Maps App Notes

Building a mobile app to indicate parking spaces and showing routes to those parking spaces is a feasible project. Here are the steps you can follow to achieve this:

API with Database:

**Database**: Choose a database system to store parking space data, such as PostgreSQL, **MySQL**, or a NoSQL database like MongoDB.
**Backend**: Create a backend API using a framework like Node.js with Express, Python with Django or Flask, Ruby on Rails, or any other server-side technology you are comfortable with.
**Data** **Model**: Design your database schema to store information about parking spaces, including their position (latitude and longitude), descriptions, availability, and other relevant details.
**API** **Endpoints**: Implement API endpoints for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to manage parking space data.
Flutter with Leaflet:

**Flutter**: Set up a Flutter project for your mobile app development. Flutter is a great choice for building cross-platform mobile apps.
**Leaflet**: Integrate the Leaflet mapping library into your Flutter app. Leaflet is a popular JavaScript library for interactive maps and can be used in Flutter using the flutter_map package.

**Displaying Parking Spaces:**
Fetch parking space data from your API using HTTP requests in your Flutter app.
Use Leaflet maps to display parking space locations on the map with custom markers. You can customize the markers to represent different types of parking spaces (e.g., free, paid, disabled-friendly).
Implement filters and search functionality to help users find parking spaces based on their preferences.

**Routing to Parking Spaces:**
Implement a feature that allows users to select a parking space on the map.
Use a routing algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm or any other routing library) to calculate the route from the user's current location to the selected parking space.
Display the calculated route on the map, including turn-by-turn directions and estimated travel time.

**User Experience:**
Focus on the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) to make your app intuitive and easy to use.
Consider adding additional features like user reviews and ratings for parking spaces, real-time availability updates, and payment integration if applicable.

**Testing and Deployment:**
Test your app thoroughly on different devices and screen sizes to ensure compatibility.
Deploy your backend API to a server or a cloud platform like AWS, Heroku, or Azure.
Publish your Flutter app to the Google Play Store for Android users and the Apple App Store for iOS users.

**Maintenance and Updates:**
Regularly update your app to improve performance, fix bugs, and add new features based on user feedback.
Remember to prioritize security, especially when handling user data or payment information. Additionally, consider the legal aspects of using mapping data, as you may need to comply with licensing and privacy regulations.

Lastly, keep in mind that building a mobile app with these features can be a complex project, so plan and scope your tasks carefully and be prepared to iterate and refine your app based on user feedback.

**SQL Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL):**

1. **Structured Data**: SQL databases are ideal for structured data with well-defined schemas. If your parking data has a consistent structure and you need to enforce data integrity, SQL may be a better choice.
    
2. **ACID Compliance**: SQL databases are known for their ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, which ensures data consistency and reliability, making them suitable for applications where data integrity is critical, such as financial or transactional systems.
    
3. **Complex Queries**: SQL databases excel at handling complex queries and aggregations. If you anticipate the need for advanced querying and reporting capabilities, SQL may be more appropriate.
    
4. **Maturity and Ecosystem**: SQL databases have been around for a long time and have a mature ecosystem with a wide range of tools and libraries available for development and administration.
    

**NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra):**

1. **Unstructured or Semi-Structured Data**: NoSQL databases are flexible and can handle unstructured or semi-structured data, making them suitable for cases where the data schema can change or evolve over time.
    
2. **Scalability**: NoSQL databases, especially those designed for horizontal scalability, are a good choice if you expect your application to have high traffic or if you need to distribute data across multiple nodes or servers.
    
3. **Speed**: NoSQL databases can be faster for certain read and write operations, especially when dealing with large volumes of data or when a high degree of concurrency is required.
    
4. **Schemaless**: NoSQL databases are schemaless, meaning you can insert data without predefined schema constraints, which can be beneficial for rapid development and prototyping.
    
5. **JSON and Document Stores**: If your parking data is structured as JSON documents, a NoSQL document store like MongoDB may be a natural fit.
    

In summary, if your parking data has a well-defined structure, and you prioritize data integrity, complex querying, and the maturity of the database system, SQL databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL may be a better choice.

On the other hand, if your data is unstructured, evolving, or you need high scalability and speed for certain operations, a NoSQL database like MongoDB could be a more suitable option.

MongoDB is a strong choice. Here's why MongoDB is a good fit:

1. **JSON-Like Documents**: MongoDB stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) format, which is a binary representation of JSON documents. This makes it a natural fit for storing semi-structured or JSON-like data, which is often the case with parking data.
    
2. **Flexibility**: MongoDB is schema-less, allowing you to store data without a predefined schema. This flexibility is useful if your parking data may evolve over time, or if different parking locations have varying attributes.
    
3. **Scalability**: MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability, making it suitable for applications that may experience rapid growth or need to distribute data across multiple servers or clusters.
    
4. **Community and Ecosystem**: MongoDB has a large and active community, which means you can find extensive documentation, tutorials, and support resources. There are also many libraries and frameworks available for various programming languages.
    
5. **Geospatial Queries**: If you plan to work with geospatial data (i.e., latitude and longitude coordinates for parking spaces), MongoDB has built-in support for geospatial indexing and queries, which can be very beneficial for your parking space locator app.
    
6. **Aggregation Framework**: MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that allows you to perform complex data transformations, filtering, and analysis directly within the database.
    
7. **Cloud Integration**: MongoDB offers managed database services on major cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, simplifying deployment and management.
    
8. **Security**: MongoDB provides robust security features, including authentication, authorization, and encryption, to help protect your data.


#### Creating a new database and collection Fastapi mongo
When you run a FastAPI application with the provided settings and connect to MongoDB, the database and collection will not be automatically created by MongoDB or FastAPI. MongoDB creates a new database and collection when you first insert data into them.

In other words, if you haven't explicitly created the database and collection before running your FastAPI application, they won't exist in MongoDB until you perform an operation that writes data to them. MongoDB is designed to be flexible and dynamic in this regard.

Here's a typical sequence of events when working with MongoDB and FastAPI:

1. You connect to MongoDB using a client and select a database and collection, as you've done in your FastAPI application.
    
2. When you insert a document into the collection using code like this:
    
    pythonCopy code
    
    `await collection.insert_one({"key": "value"})`
    
    MongoDB checks if the specified database and collection exist. If they don't, MongoDB creates them at this point.
    
3. The document is inserted into the collection.
    

So, the first time you insert data into a collection in MongoDB using your FastAPI application, MongoDB will create the database and collection automatically if they don't already exist.
